      <h1 class="display-4 step">Preparation</h1>
      <div class="dropdown-divider"></div>
      <p>Access to tooling which can cut plastic is required. The design has been optimised to use simple shapes and can
        be manufactured using a range of different processing techniques. Described below is an example which was built
        for prototyping and proof of concept purposes.It should be noted that the material and design can be modified as
        required to suit tooling and equipment available. You can find all CAD files for download <a
          href="/src/OpenGuardV1.0.zip" target="_blank">here</a>
      </p>


      <!-- PVC Headband Start -->
      <h1 class="display-5 step">Headband</h1>

      <p>This headband is made from semi-flexible plastic of thickness 1mm up to 2mm. This can be cut from sheets on an
        automated CNC punch or milling machine. Other cutting or jet processes may be suitable depending on the
        material. For our prototypes we manufactured from 2mm PVC which is inexpensive and readily available. If you
        want to mass produce these for your local community and don't have a punch machine lying around, contact a local
        engineering company and ask if they can prepare the parts for you. If this is not a service they can offer they
        will most likely point you in the right direction.</p>

      <!-- PVC Headband End -->

      <!-- Face Shields -->
      <h1 class="display-5 step">Clear Face Shields</h1>

      <p>For the face shield we used A4 binder cover acetate sheets. These are readily available both locally and
        online. To prepare the sheet we used an A4 4-hole punch to make the holes for fixing. We have rounded the
        corners of these sheets as they can be quite sharp. We did this with a scissors but could be done in bulk with a
        guillotine or punch when available.</p>

      <!-- Face Shelds End -->

      <!-- Headband Padding Start-->
      <h1 class="display-5 step">Headband Padding</h1>

      <p>The headband padding is made from foam tape with adhesive backing, 20mm wide, 5 to 10mm thick and cut to 170mm
        in length. For our prototypes we used EPDM foam but any available foam can be used. Most suppliers of adhesive
        tapes will stock this. You may also find rolls in hardware, plumbing and other parts shops. A phone call
        to any of these locations will help you source it. If they don't supply the product directly they will have a
        source for it or be able to point you in the right direction. This is easy cut using household scissors as it
        comes in long rolls.
      </p>

      <!-- Headband Paddding End -->

      <!-- Rivet Start -->
      <h1 class="display-5 step">Rivets</h1>

      <p>Rivets were chosen because they are readily available, providing a fast, heavy duty, low profile fixing of all
        components. Two kinds of rivets can be used for this application. The first is a 5mm dome head pop-rivet. This
        rivet requires a rivet gun in order to secure the fixing in place and trim the excess. It is also suggested that
        you use a mechanically assisted rivet gun over a hand riveter. Repetitive use of a hand riveter is physically
        straining. The best will in the world will be broken if you try to assemble any more than 20 of these in one go
        without one. These are expensive tools, it may be possible to rent one or have one donated by a tool supplier.
      </p>

        <figcaption class="figure-caption">Dome Head Rivit</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>The second kind of rivet is a 5mm plastic push rivet. These are also readily available from local and online
        sellers. These rivets need to have a grip depth of approx. 3mm to maintain comfort for the person wearing it.
        Push rivets are a tooless soltuion and can be popped into place by hand. These rivets dont have the same
        strength as the pop-rivets and will be more likely to separate during extended use of the guard.
      </p>

      <img src="images/image5.jpg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded">

      <p>Using the 4-hole punch, make 4 holes along the edge of the plastic binder cover acetate. Round the corners of
        the plastic sheet to ensure the other PPE is not cut or the user is not injured.

      <p>Bring the inner headband with foam, outer headband and punched visor together. Fix all together using pop or
        plastic rivets. Repeat this on both sides. The outer headband will require a little pressure to have it bend to
        shape to align the rivet holes. The two rivets at the front can be inserted or omitted if the structure is
        secure enough without them.
      </p>
      <img src="images/illustration1.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded">

      <img src="images/image18.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded">

      <p>Once completed bend the toothed side of the outer headband around the non toothed side of the outer headband
        and pass it through the rectangle hole. You will need to twist the toothed side of the headband in order for it
        to pass through the locking hole.
        This is the adjustable mechanism for fitting the headband to the size of the user's head. Once correctly
        adjusted, pass the excess toothed material through the larger second rectangle hole to tidy it away. </p>

    <li>Clean using an alcohol wipe before use</li>
    <li>Date : DD-MM-YY</li>
    <br>
    <p>
      The pack date allows the user to quarantine the bags for a number of days to ensure an adequate time delay between
      packing and use. Please use guidelines from the WHO website or government bodies to ensure adequate advised time
      has lapsed such that any pathogens contained within the bag during packaging have been rendered inactive.
