    <div>
      <h1 class="display-4">Prerequisites</h1>


      <div class="dropdown-divider"></div>
      <p>There is a number of prerequisites required to prepare the parts. This headband is made from 2mm PVC.
        This PVC comes in large sheets and is cut using a Punch Machine. This allows for the quick production of parts
        and 2mm PVC is inexensive and readily available. If you want to mass produce these for your local community one
        option is to contact a local enginnering business and ask if they can prepare the parts for you. Any punch
        machine could prepare a large number of the PVC parts. Alternativly CNC machines could cut the sheets using the
        drawings attached. In
        general if you ask the question they will at the very least pointing you in the right direction. </p>

      <p>For the face shield we used A4 acetate sheets. These are readily available both locally and online. To prepare
        the sheet we used an A4 4 hole punch to make the holes for fixing. We have rounded the cornors of these sheets
        as they can be quite sharp. We did this with a scisors but could be done in bulk with a guillotine or punch when
        available.</p>

      <img src="faceguardv1-0/img/4holepunch.jpg">

      <p>The headband padding is made from single sided PVC foam tape. This is less readily available than the other
        parts. For the most part suppliers of adhesive tapes will supply this. You may also find rolls of it in
        hardware, plumbing or parts shops. Again, these people will point you in the right directon over a phone call if
        they dont supply it directly. This is easy cut using a household scissors as it comes in long rolls. </p>

      <img src="faceguardv1-0/img/foam-tape.jpg">

      <p>It is also suggested that you use a mechanically assisted rivit gun over a hand riviter. The best will in the
        world will be broken if you try assemble any more than 20 of these in one go without one.</p>
